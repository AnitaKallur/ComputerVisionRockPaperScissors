Computer vision Rock Paper Scissors game
I have used TeachableMachine to train the model to identify hand gestures.
After traing the model, combine the hand gesture file and code the rock paper scissors game with functions. 
Once everything is aligned, we are ready to play the game using camera. 
I have made this game using simple codes which is easily understandable. 
I may consider adding few more features to the game in future.
